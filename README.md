# revised-MENTORED-PROJECT

THE TASK AT HAND:

Revision of the 4 week mentored project within 6 hours on a buggy VM... (delightful)

By Sakeena Ali

**What was the Challenge?**

To create a HR application which contains employee information, that also needed to capture the following data:

Employee's NI Number

Employee's Full Name

Employee's Phone number

Employee's Address

Employee's Department 

The project must be written in PURE JavaScript
All the employee information should be displayed on the screen
Users must be able to add an employee to the list
Users must be able to edit employee information
Users must be able to delete an employee
Users must be able to filter the list of employees based on their department through a dropdown box / search bar - i.e. HR, Sales etc. ( this is the only requirement I could not do) **this I completed today** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ 
and I had to  create separate files for your HTML, JS, CSS etc.

**How I expected the challenge to go**

I had a good idea by now, feeling fairly confident having taken the oppurtunity to learn and develop my skills and understanding, from the first submission to now, I coded and practiced a little everyday. 

**What went well**

If starting from scratch, there was no way, I could have done this within 6 hours, let alone even 24 hours! However, it was to edit and modify the code to meet the CRUD expectations. The filter was not too difficult, I continually inspected the console to see why sometimes things were not working, its a case of practice. I kept to a basic CSS, out went the parma violet design ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ and in with a dreary grey to match the weather outside (currently it was the best front end style library I could use to remotely give the application a responsive layout).

**What didnt go as planned?**
Everything went pretty smoothly this time, I would have liked more colour in my overall design this is something Im not experienced enough in yet, I have looked into bootstrap, however I went with something a little more simple and basic. Also initially moving the javascript out of the html file, at one point my edit function stopped working, however fixed that in no time. 


**Possible improvements for future challenges**
Learn bootstrap or front-end design, improve my CSS skills to maybe make the form a little more pleasing to the eye.
